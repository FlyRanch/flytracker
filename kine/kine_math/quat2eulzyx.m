% Function QUAT2EULZYX(q)
% 
% CALLING FUNCTION: obj_function (frame)
% ACTIONS: Convert quaternion to Euler angles in ZYX scheme
% PARENT PROGRAM: Kine_v3_0
% LAST MODIFIED: September 26, 2007 by gwyneth
%
% Input, q, is a unit quaternion representing a rotation.
% The outputs are Euler angles in radians representing a rotation around
% axes in the lab frame, in the following order:
%   1) phi (bank, rotation around x-axis)
%   2) theta (elevation, rotation around y-axis)
%   3) psi (heading, rotation around z-axis)
%
% This corresponds to a rotation matrix composed as: RzRyRx
%
% Note: Euler angles can be thought of as representing rotations around
% fixed axes in the lab frame OR as representing rotations around
% non-orthogonal axes that rotate sequentially as the object is rotated.
